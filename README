Gtk2::Ex::CellLayout::Base provides a basic set functions for use in
new data viewer widgets written in Perl and wanting to implement the
Gtk2::CellLayout interface.

This code started life in Gtk2::Ex::TickerView, but a renderers list
in Gtk2::CellLayout style is pretty much the same in every new viewer,
so it's offered here for general use.

A few subtleties of GtkCellLayout aren't particularly well documented
in the Gtk reference manual, so even if you decide you don't like this
code you might still see if you agree with some of the various details
of packing order and attribute application.

The only prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and Scope::Guard.  Gtk2-Perl
1.180 or higher is needed to implement GtkCellLayout as an actual
GInterface from Perl code.
